# A Lethal Company Overhaul for [Naidaru's 2023 LC Mod Jam](https://itch.io/jam/2023-lethal-company-modjam)
### ***MAKE THE COMPANY ~~PROUD~~ PRETTY***

As a long standing employee for ***THE COMPANY*** it's only fit that you be promoted to a highly skilled janitorial taskforce burdened with cleaning up after amateur scavengers so ***THE COMPANY*** remains operating within its regulations.  
**Getting scrap is easy; it's hard making it look like nothing happened.**

## Inspired by Viscera Cleanup, this mod changes the game in the following ways
* Replaces all scrap with 'messes'
* Messes can be cleaned to get one of two processed trash items to sell
    * Full Trash Bag
    * Dirty Water Bucket
* There are 4 tools for cleaning specific messes
    * Mop - *Scavenger Remains, Thumper Drool*
    * Broom - *Bracken dust, coilhead nails*
    * Box of Garbage Bags - *Bone Pile, Hoarder Bug Eggs*
    * Vacuum - *Ethereal Essence, Spore Pile*
* Dead creatures are now two handed scrap that can spawn
    * Dead scavenger - You'll find some dead orange suit scavengers in the facilities.
    * Dead Hoarder Bugs
    * Dead Spiders
    * Dead Thumpers
    * Dead Snare Fleas
    * Lots of people and things die on scavenger runs, they're worth a decent amount to retrieve.
* Creatures you kill can be picked up and sold
    * If you neutralize it, you sanitize it
* Default player suit is replaced with a snazzy Janitor suit
* Intro, 0 days left alert, and fired voice lines are replaced by custom janitor voicelines.
